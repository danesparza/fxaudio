# There are a few special things we need to do to use ALSA and
# cvlc.
# First, vlc can't be called by the 'root' user, so we need to create a user.
# Second, the user we create has to be in the 'audio' group in order to use ALSA devices

# Create the user fxaudio if it doesn't exist:
id -u fxaudio &>/dev/null || sudo useradd fxaudio

# Add fxaudio to the audio group
sudo usermod -aG audio fxaudio
